## Matillion ETL on AWS

This Quick Start deploys Matillion ETL for Amazon Redshift on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in either a single instance with an external Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database or high availability (HA) cluster in about 20 minutes, following AWS best practices.

Matillion ETL for Amazon Redshift is an extract, transform, and load/extract, load, and transform (ETL/ELT) tool that automates data loads and transformations for greater speed, scale, and savings in the enterprise.

You can load data into Amazon Redshift from data sources such as on-premises and cloud databases, cloud and software as a service (SaaS) applications, application programming interfaces (APIs), files, and NoSQL databases. After your data is available in Amazon Redshift, you can combine transformation components in Matillion ETL to build complex data transformations for visualizations, business intelligence, reporting, and advanced analytics.
